/**
 * Bulk import plugin e2e test configuration.
 * Extends the base config from rhdh-e2e-test-utils.
 *
 * Projects:
 * - bulk-import — legacy app shell (default RHIDP merge layers).
 * - bulk-import-app-next — namespace ends with -app-next, so e2e-test-utils merges
 *   NFS (app-next) secrets and default app-auth / app-integrations automatically.
 *   Runs the same spec as the legacy lane; the rationale for why its locators need
 *   no branching is next to BULK_IMPORT_HEADING in support/constants.
 * - bulk-import-orchestrator — legacy shell, orchestrator-mode config. Deliberately
 *   has no app-next counterpart: it also needs the orchestrator operator.
 * - bulk-import-scaffolder-template — scaffolder-based import flow (GitHub OAuth,
 *   template execution, PR creation). Deliberately has no app-next counterpart:
 *   it exercises the /create template flow, not the bulk-import UI under the NFS
 *   shell, so running it once on the legacy shell is sufficient.
 * - bulk-import-permission — guest-auth (development environment) deployment, its own
 *   namespace. Kept separate from bulk-import because RHDH only renders the guest
 *   "Enter" sign-in tile under a development/guest deployment, not the production
 *   GitHub deployment the other bulk-import tests share. Deliberately has no
 *   app-next counterpart for the same reason as bulk-import-orchestrator: it tests
 *   RBAC denial behavior, which is shell-independent.
