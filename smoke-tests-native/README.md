# Native (Docker-free) smoke harness

Validates RHDH dynamic **backend** plugins in-process — install via the published
`install-dynamic-plugins` CLI, then boot with `startTestBackend` — with **no Docker
container and no cluster**. About **20x faster** than the per-workspace `docker run rhdh`
smoke-test it replaces for that scope.

**Tickets:** RHIDP-15075, RHIDP-15076, RHIDP-13530 (epic RHIDP-13501);
RHIDP-13510 for the support-level sweep (epic RHIDP-13497).

## Why

The repo's container smoke-test boots RHDH in Docker (`docker run rhdh …`) just to check a
plugin loads. An earlier native attempt (PR #2231) was closed because it was 694 lines of
bespoke OCI parsing and predated the npm CLI. Now that `install-dynamic-plugins` is
published — and RHDH already uses it in-process in `plugin-dynamic-loading.spec.ts`
(PR #4967) — that extraction collapses to one CLI call, so the smoke validation runs
in-process with no container.

## What it does

```
install CLI (extract OCI → dynamic-plugins-root, run with cwd=root)
  → discoverPlugins()         # scan install dirs, classify by package.json backstage.role
  → loadBackendPlugins()      # require() each, assert default BackendFeature
  → startTestBackend()        # boot core + loaded features in-process (+ rootConfig)
  → validateFrontendBundle()  # both manifests usable; configSchema shipped (not executed)
  → results.json + exit code
```

### Frontend bundle validation (both frontend systems)

The check recognizes both packagings and records which one(s) each plugin ships in
`results.json` (`frontend.bundles[].systems`):

| System                                  | Required artifacts                                                        | Example plugin           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Legacy (Scalprum)                       | `dist-scalprum/` + `plugin-manifest.json`                                 | most current plugins     |
| New frontend system (module federation) | `dist/mf-manifest.json` (the asset it names need not be `remoteEntry.js`) | `app-auth` (new-FE only) |
| Dual                                    | both layouts                                                              | `tech-radar`             |

A present-but-incomplete layout fails even if the other system's layout is valid.

Both halves validate the manifest's **shape**, not just its presence, and separately the
bundle is required to ship the config schema it declares. Presence is what let two silent
customer bugs through — RHDHBUGS-2180 on the manifests, RHDHBUGS-1157 on the schema. In
each, the artifact is there, the app boots, nothing errors, and the plugin is either absent
or running on its defaults.

#### Scalprum manifest (`frontend.bundles[].scalprum`)

`dist-scalprum/plugin-manifest.json` is parsed and checked against what the host needs
(RHDHBUGS-2180):

| Field                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`               | the host registers the remote under this, and RHDH matches app-config `dynamicPlugins.frontend.<key>` against it. Missing ⇒ **fails**: no mount point can be addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `loadScripts`        | the assets the host fetches to initialise the plugin. Not an array, empty, carrying an entry that is not a non-empty asset name, escaping `dist-scalprum/`, or naming something the bundle does not contain as a file ⇒ **fails**: the host fetches a 404, the registration callback never runs, every configured route answers 404. Escaping and absent get different messages, as they do on the MF side |
| `missingScripts`     | the `loadScripts` entries with no usable asset behind them — the evidence for the row above                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `extensionCount`     | how many extensions the manifest declares. **Reported, never failed on** — see below. `null` when the field is not an array at all, which does fail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `registrationMethod` | `callback` for everything RHDH publishes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

`extensionCount: 0` is the normal shape, not a defect: `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli` constructs
its `DynamicRemotePlugin` with a literal `extensions: []`, so all 76 published frontend
bundles report 0, and the SDK's own manifest schema permits it (`z.array(...)` with no
`.nonempty()`, while `loadScripts` is `.nonempty()`). With `registrationMethod: "callback"`
the plugin registers at runtime and RHDH drives its surfaces from app-config mount points,
so a static extension list is not where anything is declared. Failing on it would fail the
entire catalogue and could never go green.

#### Config schema (`frontend.bundles[].configSchema`)

A bundle that declares configuration must ship the schema for it, or Backstage has nothing
to match the plugin's app-config keys against and drops them without a word — the plugin
runs on its defaults while the operator's settings look applied (RHDHBUGS-1157).

The consumer is `gatherDynamicPluginsSchemas` in
`@backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service`, and **RHDH overrides its locator**
(`rhdh:packages/backend/src/index.ts`):

```ts
schemaLocator(pluginPackage) {
  const platform = PackageRoles.getRoleInfo(pluginPackage.manifest.backstage.role).platform;
  return path.join(platform === "node" ? "dist" : "dist-scalprum", "configSchema.json");
},
```

`PackageRoles.getRoleInfo("frontend-plugin").platform` is `"web"`, so for every package this
check inspects RHDH reads **`dist-scalprum/configSchema.json`** — never
`dist/.config-schema.json`, which is only the upstream default. The export writes one file
per consumer, which is why there are two:

| Role              | RHDH reads                        | Upstream default reads     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `frontend-plugin` | `dist-scalprum/configSchema.json` | `dist/.config-schema.json` |
| `backend-plugin`  | `dist/configSchema.json`          | `dist/.config-schema.json` |

Only RHDH's path is failed on, and it is checked **whether or not `dist-scalprum/` exists** —
its absence is the fault. Gating it on the directory left an NFS-only bundle, which ships no
`dist-scalprum/` at all, passing while RHDH dropped its config in silence. The upstream copy
is reported with `consumer: "upstream-default"` and never failed: rejecting an artifact over
a file this platform ignores would be a false positive.

The gatherer drops a schema in four ways, which is what the states below mirror:

```js
if (!await fs.pathExists(schemaLocation)) continue;   // missing -> silent
if (!serialized) continue;                            // null    -> silent
if (isEmpty(serialized)) continue;                    // {}      -> silent
if (serialized?.backstageConfigSchemaVersion === 1) { // wrapped form: merged first,
  serialized = mergeConfigSchemas(serialized.schemas.map(_ => _.value)); //  not modelled here
}
if (!serialized?.$schema || serialized?.type !== "object") {
  logger.error("Serialized configuration schema is invalid for plugin ...");
  continue;                                           // invalid -> logged
}
```

Only the last is not silent, and a line in a backend log is not much louder than nothing for
an artifact published weeks earlier — the config is dropped either way. The wrapped form is
not modelled here: `export-dynamic-plugin` never writes it, and judging it would mean
reimplementing the merge.

`declared` is `configSchema` on the shipped `package.json`, Backstage's own signal, with
`declaredError` beside it for when `package.json` could not be read at all — a failure to
look must not be published as `declared: false`, the same reason `mf.nfsFeaturesError`
exists. `files` carries one entry per path `export-dynamic-plugin` writes for the layouts
the bundle ships — `dist-scalprum/configSchema.json` and `dist/.config-schema.json`
(different filename) — each tagged with its `consumer` and carrying a state of `ok`, `missing`, `unreadable`,
`empty` or `invalid`, plus its `propertyCount`.

Note what `ok` does and does not establish. The export writes the schema MERGED across the
package and its filtered dependency tree, so `ok` means some schema survived, not that this
plugin's own keys did — a declaring package whose `config.d.ts` was lost still reports `ok`
as soon as one dependency contributed a property (11 of the 76 published packages ship a
schema built purely from dependencies). Proving the plugin's own keys survived would mean
compiling its `config.d.ts`, which is the export's job. The check catches the total loss,
which is what RHDHBUGS-1157 was.

**Only `declared: true` — or a `package.json` that could not be read at all — can fail.** The export merges the package's own `configSchema` with
every one it finds in the dependency tree, so an empty schema means "declares nothing" for
most packages and "the declaration was lost" only for the ones that declare: 33 of 76
declare, 32 ship an empty schema, and only the intersection is a finding. Failing on an
empty schema alone would accuse 32 packages of a bug they do not have, so the messages keep
"declares no configuration" and "declares configuration and shipped no schema" apart.

#### Module-federation manifest (`frontend.bundles[].mf`)

Presence is not enough here either: the remotes router in
`@backstage/backend-dynamic-feature-service` logs and `continue`s past a manifest missing
any field it needs, so `GET /.backstage/dynamic-features/remotes` still answers `200 []`
and the browser gets an app that boots cleanly with no plugins.

| Field                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`               | `mf-manifest.json` `name` — the host registers the remote under this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `remoteEntry`        | `metaData.remoteEntry.name` — must exist on disk, under `metaData.remoteEntry.path` when that is set and contained within `dist/`. A missing or escaping asset is a **bundle** fault, not a router one — `servable` stays true, because the router resolves its own entry from `name` alone and never reads `path`. The router itself serves the manifest as the entry (its default `getRemoteEntryType()` is `"manifest"`); this asset is what the MF runtime fetches after reading it |
| `exposes`            | module names the remote exposes; every entry must carry a `name`, but an empty list is valid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `nfsFeatures`        | entry points whose `backstage.features` type the new frontend system mounts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `nfsFeaturesExposed` | the subset of `nfsFeatures` the manifest actually exposes.

| `servable`           | whether the **router** will serve the remote rather than skipping it — set only by the router's own guards, so a broken bundle does not flip it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

`servable` and the feature fields are reported apart because they are two different
problems and both are silent at runtime. `servable: false` is an artifact defect and
**fails** the run. A served remote that may contribute nothing **warns**, and the two
cases read differently on purpose:

- **declares NFS entry points but does not expose them** — `nfsModuleFilter` installs a
  filter that keeps no modules, so NFS mounts nothing. Definitive.
- **declares no `backstage.features` at all** — `nfsModuleFilter` returns no resolver, so
  every exposed module is advertised and the frontend loader decides at runtime by each
  module's `$$type`. Whether anything mounts **cannot be told from metadata**, and the
  harness says so rather than guessing.

Nine published frontend packages are in the second state today (`argocd`, `qe-theme`, the
six `@roadiehq/*`, and `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-module-addons-contrib`). Failing either would turn six
workspaces red for work that belongs upstream. See [`docs/nfs-e2e-triage.md`](../docs/nfs-e2e-triage.md).

`src/loader.ts` and `src/{module-resolution,plugin-config}.ts` are ported from RHDH
PR #4967; `discoverPlugins()` replaces RHDH's `loadManifest()` because this CLI version
lays out one dir per plugin instead of emitting a `manifest.json`.

## What it deliberately does NOT do

It does **not render frontend UI**. `startTestBackend` is backend-only. UI-behaviour tests
(the 24 overlay `e2e-tests`, which are ~all Playwright `uiHelper`-driven) need a real
frontend — that is the **NFS / app-next** path (RHIDP-15082), intentionally out of scope.

## Run

Requires Node 24 and Yarn 4 (matching the repo's `versions.json` and the sibling
`workspaces/*/e2e-tests`), plus registry access to pull the OCI plugin images.

`better-sqlite3` is opted into building via `dependenciesMeta` in `package.json`: Yarn
4.17.1 made `enableScripts: false` the default, and without its native binding every
`startTestBackend()` boot fails with `Could not locate the bindings file`. The opt-in is
per package rather than a blanket `enableScripts: true`, so nothing else in the tree runs
install scripts.

```bash
yarn install

cat > dp.yaml <<'YAML'
plugins:
  - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/<plugin>:<tag>!<name>
YAML
yarn smoke --dynamic-plugins dp.yaml
```

### Workspace mode

Validate ALL published plugins of a workspace together — the same unit the Docker
smoke covers:

```bash
yarn smoke --workspace mcp-integrations
```

It resolves every `oci://` `spec.dynamicArtifact` from
`workspaces/<name>/metadata/*.yaml` and installs/boots them in one run. Metadata
whose artifact is a local `./dynamic-plugins/dist/…` path (plugin bundled inside the
RHDH image, no published OCI artifact — e.g. `scaffolder-backend-module-kubernetes`)
is skipped with a warning and recorded in `results.json`
(`workspace.skippedMetadata`); a workspace with no `oci://` refs at all reports
`status: error` (nothing to validate). `--workspace` and `--dynamic-plugins` are
mutually exclusive.

Workspace mode also auto-discovers the workspace's Docker-smoke test config —
`workspaces/<name>/smoke-tests/app-config.test.yaml` and `smoke-tests/test.env` —
when present. Explicit `--app-config`/`--test-env` flags win over discovered files.

### Support-level sweep (RHIDP-13510)

Community-supported plugins are **not in the RHDH image** — RHIDP-13262 removed them from
`default.packages.yaml` — so they exist only as artifacts this repo publishes to ghcr.io,
and nothing else validates them. The rhdh repo's sanity check (RHIDP-13508) sweeps the
catalog index, which by design carries only generally-available `quay.io/rhdh` packages:
zero overlap.

`yarn sweep` closes that gap by selecting packages from metadata and driving the harness
once per workspace:

```bash
yarn sweep --support community --shards 6 --plan      # print the shard plan, run nothing
yarn sweep --support community --shards 6 --shard 0   # run one shard
yarn sweep --support community                        # run everything in one shard
yarn aggregate --in results --summary summary.md \
  --expect-shards 6                                   # merge; fail if a shard is missing
```

The selection reads `spec.support` from the workspace metadata rather than the
repo-root `rhdh-community-packages.txt` that AGENTS.md describes: the metadata is what
the build actually publishes from, and the two disagree today (41 workspaces carry a
community package; the txt file names 20).

**`spec.support` is the classifier, not the npm scope.** `@backstage-community/plugin-topology`
and `-tech-radar` are generally-available; `quay`, `tekton` and `3scale` are community.
Selecting by npm org resolves the wrong set. Because selection is metadata-driven, a new
workspace is covered the day its metadata lands rather than when someone hand-writes a
smoke test — which matters given that 15 of the 41 community workspaces have neither
`smoke-tests/` nor `e2e-tests/`.

The workspace is the unit of work: its plugins share the `smoke-tests/` config the harness
auto-discovers, and it is the unit the Docker smoke already uses. Each workspace runs as
its own harness **process**, so a plugin that crashes Node costs one workspace's result
rather than the shard's. `planShards` balances on package count and is deterministic, so
the planning job and each sharded job compute the same plan without passing lists around.

#### What this sweep can and cannot assert

The operative requirement for this tier is **"the published artifact installs and boots"**
(rhdh's `docs/testing-requirements-matrix.md`, reworded in rhdh#5212 — the old phrasing, "loads
without error in a default RHDH instance", was orphaned when community plugins left the
image).

| Scope                             | Coverage                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All community packages            | OCI install + dynamic-plugin layout validation                                   |
| Community backend packages        | real boot via `startTestBackend`                                                 |
| Catalog-extending backend modules | install + bundle layout, no boot — see `plugin-sweep-excludes.txt` (RHIDP-16017) |
| Community frontend packages       | bundle-layout validation only                                                    |

**This is breadth, not depth.** Frontend plugins get no UI render — that is RHIDP-16009,
blocked on RHIDP-15082. The layout check stays because it costs nothing extra (the install
already produces it) and it is the only automated detector of a half-migrated frontend
plugin: it fails a present-but-incomplete layout even when the other system's layout is
valid.

#### Frontend-system migration panel

Every run records which system each frontend bundle ships (`frontend.bundles[].systems`),
and `yarn aggregate` rolls that up into legacy-only / new-frontend-system-only / dual
counts. Run on a schedule, that gives the NFS migration a continuously refreshed view
across the community frontend packages — data the migration has no other automated source
for today.

**Read the new-frontend-system count with its qualifier.** `systems` gains
`new-frontend-system` from the presence of `dist/mf-manifest.json` — module-federation
_layout_, which RHDH also uses to ship legacy Scalprum plugins — so on its own it
overstates. Beside the counts the panel prints a `nfsSupport` split, also recorded per
package in `aggregate.json`:

Quote `confirmed` as migration progress. The 2026-08-21 community sweep was 46 dual, of
which 19 confirmed and 27 undetermined — and ten of those 27 expose an `alpha` module, so
calling them legacy would be as wrong as calling them migrated. Before reading an
`undetermined` count as "declares nothing", check `nfsFeaturesError` on those packages:
any that failed to read are "we could not look", which is a different problem.

#### Tracked exclusions

`plugin-sweep-excludes.txt` lists packages the sweep skips, following the discipline of
RHDH's `e2e-tests/local-harness/plugin-sanity-excludes.txt` (PR #4967): **every entry
carries a `TODO(TICKET)`, and a pattern with no ticket is a parse error.** The goal is to
delete entries, not accumulate them.

Two scopes, because collapsing them would throw away coverage that costs nothing:

- `install` — the artifact is not pulled at all. Loses everything.
- `boot` — the artifact **is** pulled and layout-validated; the plugin is just not loaded
  into `startTestBackend`. Loses only the boot signal.

Patterns match the npm package name, and see through the dynamic export's `-dynamic`
suffix so one pattern is valid at both scopes (metadata says `@scope/plugin-a`, the
installed `package.json` says `@scope/plugin-a-dynamic`).

### Test config (parity with the Docker smoke)

Workspaces that ship `smoke-tests/app-config.test.yaml` and/or `smoke-tests/test.env`
(consumed by the Docker smoke as an extra `--config` mount and `docker run --env-file`)
are supported via two optional flags:

```bash
yarn smoke --dynamic-plugins dp.yaml \
  --app-config ../workspaces/<name>/smoke-tests/app-config.test.yaml \
  --test-env   ../workspaces/<name>/smoke-tests/test.env
```

- `--test-env`: `KEY=VALUE` lines loaded into the process env. Variables already set
  (e.g. real CI secrets) win over the committed placeholders. (Named `--test-env`
  because Node claims `--env-file` for itself even after the script path.)
- `--app-config`: extra app-config layer, deep-merged over the harness's built-in dummy
  config (the file wins). `${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}` are substituted from the env with
  the Backstage config loader's semantics: `$$` escapes to a literal `$`, and a value
  referencing an unset variable with no default is dropped (with a warning), not
  replaced by an empty string.

`yarn test` runs the unit tests (`node:test` over `src/*.test.ts` — workspace and
support-level resolution, shard planning, exclusion parsing, path containment, report
schema guards, config merging, aggregation and Markdown rendering, env/app-config
substitution, frontend bundle matrix); `yarn check` runs `tsc --noEmit` + lint +
prettier + the tests.

The two CLIs keep their logic in `src/sweep-plan.ts` and `src/aggregate-report.ts`
rather than beside their entry points: a module ending in `process.exit(main())` cannot
be imported by a test, so anything living there is untestable by construction. This is a standalone tool dir, not a
`workspaces/*/e2e-tests` one, so it is outside `e2e-code-quality.yaml` (which only scans
`workspaces/*/e2e-tests/**`).

### CI

`.github/workflows/native-smoke.yaml` runs the harness two ways:

- **`pull_request`** (paths `smoke-tests-native/**`): validates the harness itself on every
  change here, against a known-good pure-backend plugin.
- **`workflow_dispatch`**: Actions → "Native Smoke Harness" → Run workflow, with an optional
  `plugin_ref` (single ref) or `workspace` (all of a workspace's published plugins)
  to validate on demand.

It installs skopeo, builds, runs `yarn smoke`, uploads `results.json`, and fails the job on
a non-passing plugin.

`.github/workflows/community-plugin-sweep.yaml` runs the sweep daily at 03:00 UTC (and on
demand, with a `support` / `shards` choice). Three jobs: `plan` resolves the shard matrix
from metadata and pulls nothing, `sweep` runs the shards with `fail-fast: false` so one bad
plugin cannot hide the verdict on the rest, and `aggregate` merges the shard summaries into
one step summary — it runs unless the run was cancelled (`!cancelled()`), since the aggregate report is
most useful exactly when shards failed — but a cancelled sweep is not a failed one.

Exit code `0` = pass; non-zero with `results.json` detailing `fail-load` / `fail-start` /
`fail-bundle`.

## Best fit (from the 64-workspace analysis, RHIDP-15076)

Of the 12 pure-backend workspaces, validated empirically:

- **Covered now (4)**: `mcp-integrations` (3 plugins boot together), `github-notifications`,
  `scaffolder-backend-module-{servicenow,sonarqube}` — load + backend start via their
  published OCI refs.
- **Catalog-gated (6)**: `3scale, ai-integrations, apiconnect, keycloak, pingidentity,
scaffolder-relation-processor` — blocked by the upstream catalog-backend boot issue
  (see the caveat at the bottom); they stay on the Docker smoke for now.
- **No published OCI artifact (2)**: `scaffolder-backend-module-{kubernetes,regex}` —
  their released `dynamicArtifact` is a local `./dynamic-plugins/dist/…` path (plugin
  ships inside the RHDH image), so there is nothing for this harness to pull.

Beyond those:

- **32 smoke-tests** → replace the Docker container with this harness (backend start +
  frontend bundle/registration check).
- **24 UI e2e-tests** → NOT this harness; need the NFS/app-next render harness.

## Status of validation

- ✅ Install CLI interface confirmed: `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli-module-install-dynamic-plugins@0.3.0`
  (`install <dynamic-plugins-root>`), fetchable via `npx`.
- ✅ Harness logic ported from the **already-green** RHDH nightly test (PR #4967).
- ✅ Builds clean (esbuild → `dist/native-smoke.mjs`, run with plain `node`); `tsc --noEmit` passes.
- ✅ `patchModuleResolution()` ported (`src/module-resolution.ts`) so extracted plugins
  resolve their `@backstage/*` peers against this harness's `node_modules`. Requires a
  node-modules linker — see `.yarnrc.yml`.
- ✅ End-to-end run done locally (Node 24) against a real catalog-index plugin: `pass`,
  backend loaded 1/1, `startTestBackend` booted — see the Benchmark section below.

## Module resolution

Extracted plugins live under a temp dir with no `node_modules` of their own, so their bare
`@backstage/*` imports must resolve against this harness. `patchModuleResolution()` (ported
from RHDH PR #4967) extends `Module._nodeModulePaths` to append `HARNESS_NODE_MODULES`
before any plugin is `require`d. This is why the package uses `nodeLinker: node-modules`
(`.yarnrc.yml`) rather than Yarn PnP — the patch needs a real `node_modules` directory to
point at.

## Benchmark: native vs Docker (real run)

Same plugin both ways: `roadiehq-scaffolder-backend-module-http-request`
(`bs_1.49.4__5.6.0`), from the real catalog index
`quay.io/rhdh-community/plugin-catalog-index:1.11-bs_1.49.4`. Same minimal app-config
(sqlite `:memory:` + guest). Node 24. The RHDH base image (`quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh:next`,
6.55 GB) was pre-pulled and is excluded from the Docker timing (one-time infra, amortized
across all workspaces in a CI run).

| Approach                                            | What it does                                                                                                                          | Wall-clock               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Native (this harness)**                           | skopeo pull plugin → load → `startTestBackend` boot                                                                                   | **5 s cold, 3–4 s warm** |
| **Docker smoke** (`run-workspace-smoke-tests.yaml`) | container start → in-container `install-dynamic-plugins` (pulls same plugin) → full `node packages/backend` boot → `/healthcheck` 200 | **104 s**                |

Roughly **20× faster cold, ~25–35× warm.** Both confirm the plugin loads; the Docker run
additionally boots the entire RHDH backend (that extra work is exactly the overhead the
in-process approach removes). Note the comparison is per-workspace — the Docker smoke boots
one container per workspace, which is the unit this harness replaces.

Caveat: the native harness currently boots a minimal backend scoped to the plugin's needs
(e.g. scaffolder for scaffolder modules). Catalog-extending modules need the catalog core,
which does not yet boot cleanly standalone — see the coreFeatures note in `src/native-smoke.ts`.
