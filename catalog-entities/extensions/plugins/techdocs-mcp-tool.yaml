     # Techdocs MCP Tool Plugin


     A backend plugin that provides a set of MCP tools to allow AI clients to interact with Techdocs on Red Hat Developer Hub


     Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standard for connecting AI models and applications (MCP clients) to external systems, enabling them to access information and workflows on those systems. MCP servers define tools which can be called by AI applications to access this data.
     RHDH supports running MCP tools through the mcp-actions-backend plugin available in Backstage.

     ### Key Features


     - **Querying Techdocs**: Supports metadata retrieval about techdocs, with flexible options for filtering
     - **Documentation Retrieval**: Allows techdoc content to be retrieved by AI clients
     - **Documentation Coverage**: Allows AI clients to retrieve information about documentation coverage in the catalog

     ## Support


     - **MCP Server Plugin**: [MCP Server README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/mcp-actions-backend/README.md)
     - **Backend Plugin**: [Backend README](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/blob/main/workspaces/mcp-integrations/README.md)
     - **Issues**: [Jira Issues](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDHBUGS)
