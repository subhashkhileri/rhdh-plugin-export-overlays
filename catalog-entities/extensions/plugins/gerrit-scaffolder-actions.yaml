    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/latest/html/installing_and_viewing_plugins_in_red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details on the configuration required.
