    The GitHub Events Backend Module enables real-time synchronization of catalog entities by receiving webhook events from GitHub. This allows your Developer Hub instance to stay updated automatically when changes occur in your GitHub repositories or organization, eliminating the need for frequent polling.

    ## Key Features

    - **GitHub Discovery Events**: Monitors push and repository events to automatically update catalog entities when `catalog-info.yaml` files are modified (Requires GitHub Discovery to be set up)
    - **Organizational Data Events**: Tracks organization, team, and membership changes to keep user and team data synchronized (Requires GitHub Organizational Data to be set up)

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
