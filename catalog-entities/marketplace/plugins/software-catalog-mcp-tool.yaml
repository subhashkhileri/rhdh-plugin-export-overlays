     # Software Catalog MCP Tool Plugin


     Red Hat Developer Hub provides an MCP server that can be used by AI assistants to interact with RHDH.


     Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standard for connecting AI models and applications (MCP clients) to external systems, enabling them to access information and workflows on those systems. MCP servers define tools which can be called by AI applications to access this data.
     RHDH supports running MCP tools through the mcp-actions-backend plugin available in Backstage.

     ### Key Features


     - **Querying Catalog Entities**: Supports metadata retrieval for software catalog entities, with flexible options for filtering
     - **Integrations with Software Templates**: Fetch in-depth information about Software Templates like parameters, steps, and deployable resources
     - **Register and Unregister Catalog Entities**: Allows for AI clients to register new catalog entities, and unregister existing entities.

     ## Support


     - **MCP Server Plugin**: [MCP Server README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/mcp-actions-backend/README.md)
