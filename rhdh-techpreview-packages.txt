# Tech Preview packages which will eventually go GA but for now we keep as wrappers until we have a GA plan
# do not include package for which we never had wrappers / bundled the package in RHDH
# NOTE: include one line per package following the format: <workspace-folder>/plugins/<plugin-folder> or whatever the workspace path is

# currently TP but moving to GA in 1.10

# we could build these in Konflux in 1.9 but because we're moving them to Commmunity in 1.10/1.11 (per PM/Eng sync meeting 01/12)
# might as well just keep the wrappers and NOT waste time in Konflux
# TODO move TP plugins into the community list in 1.10 https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-11354
